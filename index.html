            My name is Brittney Olivia. I'm a Software Developer residing in the
            Phoenix, metropolitan area. I specialize in Front End Web
            Development and UI/UX design. As part of the dev community my goal
            is to bridge the gap between designer and developer, fulfilling my
            passion for designing clean, modern websites with functionality
            geared towards enhancing user experience.

          <h2>- My Story</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming a software developer was not always my dream. I wanted to
            work in fashion like every other 16 year old girl out there.
            Specifically, I wanted to design magazine layouts for major
            magazines. You know Vouge, Nylon, W etc. In the 90's, early 2000's
            the inter-web wasn't something I really thought about. Tearing out
            magazine pages and collaging your bedroom wall was all the rage.
            Once I entered college, I dove into business, focusing on marketing
            and branding. This was a way for me to express both my logical,
            analytical side and creative side. Shortly after college I landed a
            marketing job and was the event coordinator for 49 stores in 50
            states. However, during my time in marketing I saw so many ways in
            which we could improve our site, cause lets face it first
            impressions and visuals are everything when it comes to locking in
            new costumers. A few months later I found myself neck deep in a 3
            month full stack coding bootcamp. After I graduated from the program
            I became a mentor for up and coming developers. In addition to
            mentoring, I freelance. I love taking on projects that challenge my
            front end skills and improve my development. Itâ€™s funny how life
            comes full circle. In high school I didn't even know that becoming a
            developer and building websites was something I could do. That 16
            year old me finally gets to live out her dream of creating and
            building layouts. Not yet for the fashion industry but give me time.
            As a front end web developer I get to combine my creativity, love
            for technology, marketing, branding and business all into one
            profession.
